# CaSH
You can find a short writeup about the project at www

CaSH is a shell with functionalities like environment variables, variable expansion, output and input redirection, pipelines, background execution
and a dirsum command, that uses an LLM to create a summary of your current directory.

## Features

- Pipelines with `|`
- Redirection: `<`, `>`, `>>`
- Environment variables (`export`, `unset`) and expansion (e.g., `$NAME`)
- Built-ins: `cd`, `export`, `unset`, `exit`, â€¦  
- `dirsum`: walks the current directory, collects the first N bytes of each file,
  and streams a summary via SSE using libcurl + cJSON
